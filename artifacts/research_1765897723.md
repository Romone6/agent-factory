# Research Brief: Improving User Authentication Experience

## Sources
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/search?q=user%3A+auth0+is%3Aissue+label%3A"enhancement") — GitHub issues are a rich source of user feedback and feature requests, indicating what users want from the product.
- [Auth0 Changelog](https://auth0.com/changelog) — The changelog provides insights into recent updates and changes that could be related to authentication improvements.

## Key Findings
- Users frequently request more robust password policies (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
- There is a need for multi-factor authentication (MFA) options beyond SMS.
- Feedback on the current login process indicates it can be too slow or cumbersome.
- There are requests for social logins to increase user convenience.

## Suggested Tickets
- [P1] Implement Enhanced Password Policies — Rationale: To improve security, users request stricter password policies. Concrete Change: Enforce a minimum of 12 characters with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
  
- [P2] Expand Multi-Factor Authentication Options Beyond SMS — Rationale: Users want more secure MFA options. Concrete Change: Introduce email-based MFA as an alternative to SMS.

- [P1] Optimize Login Process for Faster User Experience — Rationale: The current login process is too slow and cumbersome. Concrete Change: Implement a faster authentication mechanism through the use of biometric data (fingerprint or facial recognition) if supported by the platform.

- [P2] Integrate Social Logins to Increase Convenience — Rationale: Users want more convenient ways to log in. Concrete Change: Add social login options such as Google, Facebook, and Apple for user authentication.

## Risks / Unknowns
- **Security Concerns**: Implementing biometric data could pose privacy risks if not handled properly.
- **User Adoption**: New features like MFA or enhanced password policies may require user education to ensure adoption.
- **Integration Complexity**: Adding social logins might involve additional integration complexities with third-party services.
